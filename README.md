## Description
The README.md Generator asks a series of simple questions to help you write a basic but very functional README.md file for your github repos.

## Installation
Either download and extract the files from github or clone the repo and the application is ready to use.

## Usage
In a command prompt type "node index" from within the extracted or downloaded folder.

## Contributing
We are not accepting outside contributions at this time but look forward to doing so soon.

## Tests
We currently perform basic functional testing as we do development. Automated testing will be implemented as soon as we are capable.
